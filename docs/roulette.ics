She scored filmmaker Paul Rowley’s 2010 experimental feature\nThe Rooms\n\, which premiered at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. She has received songwriting and opera commissions from presenters including Bayerischer Rundfunk and Experiments in Opera\, and has been fortunate to perform on Naama Tsabar’s sculptural\, site-specific instruments.\nEmily is a member of the Julius Eastman Memorial Dinner and has toured with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company\, Till by Turning\, Arooj Aftab\, and the duo Christy & Emily. As a vocalist and pianist\, her recordings appear on Tzadik\, New Amsterdam Records\, SHSK’H\, The Social Registry\, Big Print\, Klangbad\, Merge\, and Jagjaguwar.\nBent Duo\nis a NYC-based experimental project that performs and creates innovative work. Founders Bill Solomon and David Friend come from classical music backgrounds and are deeply engaged in NYC’s New Music scene\, with active careers performing with major ensembles and at celebrated venues and festivals in NYC\, nationally\, and abroad. In Bent Duo\, they explore the outer reaches of experimental music practice and investigate new techniques for creating and performing new works that transcend conventional boundaries between disciplines\, frequently with a focus on queer aesthetics and social practice. They have created a varied body of original work\, including a performance piece premiered at Harvard Art Museums\, collaborative electroacoustic music with Jace Clayton\, a text-based work for Queer Percussion Research Group\, and numerous installation works for community gardens and historic queer spaces. They have been invited to lecture on their work at institutions including Hartford Art School\, Bard College\, Louisiana State University\, University of Leeds (UK)\, and Yale University.\nNaama Tsabar’s\npractice fuses elements from sculpture\, music\, performance and architecture. Her interactive works expose hidden spaces and systems\, reconceive gendered narratives\, and shift the viewing experience to one of active participation. Tsabar draws attention to the muted and unseen by propagating sound through space and sculptural form. Between sculpture and instrument\, form and sound\, Tsabar’s work lingers on the intimate\, sensual and corporeal potentials within this transitional state. Collaborating with local communities of female identifying and gender non-conforming performers\, Tsabar writes a new feminist and queer history of fluency. Tsabar’s work was presented and performed in institutions internationally\, among them The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York)\, MoMA PS1 (New York)\, Palais de Tokyo (Paris)\, The Bass Museum (Miami)\, SFMoMA (San Francisco) and the Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart (Berlin).

This year Roulette co-founder and former Artistic Director Jim Staley invited three guest curators to put together the lineups:\nWendy Eisenberg\n(1.22)\,\nChris Ryan Williams\n(1.23)\, and\nChris Cochrane\n(1.24).\nImprov Nights was originally initiated by John Zorn\, to whom Derek Bailey was a dear friend and mentor. Bailey’s passion for pure improvisation inspired generations of musicians from a wide variety of backgrounds. For these three nights we return to the Improv Night tradition that began as benefits for The Stone\, and that have been\, in many ways\, inspired by Derek Bailey’s legendary Company Weeks. Each evening will present a rotating kaleidoscope of musicians\, who will then divide into smaller improvisational units—each concert promising a unique experience.\nThursday\, January 22 // Curated by Wendy Eisenberg\nEliza Salem\ndrums\nRyan Sawyer\ndrums\nKate Gentile\ndrums\nNora Stanley\nsax\nEmmanuel Michael\nguitar\nCharmaine Lee\nvoice/electronics\nPatrick Holmes\nclarinet\nWendy Eisenberg\nguitar\nFriday\, January 23 // Curated by Chris Ryan Williams\nZeena Parkins\nharp\nBooker Stardrum\ndrums\nNate Wooley\ntrumpet\nKwami Winfield\nelectronics\nCaroline Davis\nsaxophone\nRyan Sawyer\ndrums\nAlexandra Buschman-Román\nelectronics\, vocals\nPatrick Holmes\nclarinet\nAmir ElSaffar\ntrumpet\nRafiq Batia\nguitar\nChris Williams\ntrumpet\nSaturday\, January 24 // Curated by Chris Cochrane\nSam Newsome\nsoprano sax\nDafna Naphtali\nelectronics and voice\nJames Ilgenfritz\nupright bass\nMike Pride\ndrums and percussion\nAndrew Drury\ndrums and percussion\nTheo Woodward\nelectronics\, tambura and voice\nKa Baird\nvocals\nSelendis Sebastian Alexander Johnson\nvibraphone and trombone\nShoko Nagai\npiano\, accordion and other keyboard and electronics\nSarah Bernstein\nviolin and vocals\nChris Cochrane\nguitar

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nA reading of Sharp's new book punctuated with guitar solos\, followed by duets on 8-string guitarbass\, electronics\, and saxophone.\n\nThis two part evening kicks off with a reading from\nElliott Sharp\n‘s new book\nFeedback\n(Wesleyan University Press) punctuated with guitar solos\, and followed by improvised duets with\nJames Brandon Lewis\non saxophone and electronics.\nFeedback\nis a wide-ranging meditation on music\, sound\, artificial intelligence\, consciousness\, contemporary culture\, politics\, and the life of the touring musician. In\nFeedback\,\nSharp engages in speculative thought around the origin of consciousness and what the future may hold for humanity with the advent of an Artificial Intelligence. The book is informed by his expansive background as one of the central figures in NYC’s Downtown Scene\, as well as his practice as a  composer\, producer\, multi-instrumentalist\, visual artist\, educator\, and studies in physics and genetics.\nFeedback\nexplores the “Improviser’s Mind” in the context of post-quantum physics\, probability\, socio-acoustics\, and Butoh dance.\nFollowing the reading\, Sharp will perform duets with saxophonist and composer\nJames Brandon Lewis\n\, a virtuoso player and brilliant musical thinker whose compositional strategies are inspired by molecular biology. Lewis has developed a special system for surprising and beautiful music with his Quartet with drummer Chad Taylor\, pianist Aruán Ortiz\, and bassist Brad Jones. Sharp and Lewis debuted their visceral and exploratory duet at Constellation in Chicago in March 2025.\nElliott Sharp\nauthor\, 8-string guitarbass\, electronics\nJames Brandon Lewis\nsaxophones\, electronics\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nElliott Sharp\nis a composer\, multi-instrumentalist\, producer\, visual artist\, and author who leads the projects Orchestra Carbon\, SysOrk\, Tectonics and Terraplane. His compositional strategies have encompassed the use of fractal geometry\, chaos theory\, algorithms\, genetic metaphors\, and new techniques for graphic notation to yield work that catalyzes a synesthetic approach to musicmaking as well as functioning as retinal art. In 2015\, Sharp was awarded both the Berlin Prize and the Jahrespreis from der Deutscher Schallplatten Kritiks. In 2014 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Fellowship from the Center for Transformative Media. He has been featured in the Darmstadt and Huddersfield festivals\, New Music Stockholm\, Au Printemps-Paris\, Hessischer Rundfunk Klangbiennale\, and the Venice Biennale.\nJames Brandon Lewis\nis a jazz saxophonist and composer whose work is inspired by a vast array of influences and bridges the divide between the avant-garde and popular mainstream. A virtuoso player\, Lewis’ playing is raw-toned but measured and isn’t steeped in current jazz-academy values. His “Molecular Systematic Music” is inspired by biological systems which he uses to create unique ensemble music. In his project\, Heroes Are Gang Leaders\, the dense multi-layered sound features the wily poetry of Thomas Sayers Ellis. Abstraction is Deliverance is the latest album from his quartet with pianist Aruán Ortiz\, bassist Brad Jones\, and drummer Chad Taylor and featuring eight of his own compositions. Among other awards\, Lewis is the recipient of the Balvenie Fellowship.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nA subversive interrogation on the soloist-with-strings tradition opened by a meditative performance on Hardanger d'amore.\n\nMichael Foster with Strings\nshares re-arranged and deconstructed interpretations of standards such as “Solitude” (Duke Ellington / Billy Strayhorn)\, “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes” (The Platters)\, “Sunset & The Mockingbird” (Duke Ellington)\, as well as pieces by Fred Anderson\, Joe McPhee\, and Fabio Frizzi.\nMichael Foster\nsaxophones\nWebb Crawford\nelectric guitar and tenor banjo\nZosha Warpeha\nhardanger fiddle\nRocio Sanchez\ncello\nLeila Bordreuil\ncello\nAnna Abondolo\nbass\nNava Dunkelman\npercussion\nZosha Warpeha\nwill open the evening with a meditative solo performance on Hardanger d’amore and voice. Known for creating music at the intersection of contemporary improvisation and folk traditions\, a recent review in The Wire of Warpeha’s latest collaborative record\nOrbweaver\n(Outside Time)\, describes the work as “Improvisation that\, in spite of its experimental edge\, feels decidedly human.”\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nMichael Foster\nwith Strings is a radical take on the soloist-with-strings tradition. Inverting\, exposing\, & subverting the power relations therein\, while mining the tradition for clues to a more queer and equitable future within both repertoire and the dynamics between ensemble and bandleader. This projects aims to unpack the concept of a Great American Songbook by placing that repertoire in dialogue with works by overlooked\, contemporary composers\, and with an approach to ensemble playing that integrates elements of noise and free improvisation. This ensemble proposes approaching standards and composition with the same dynamism and openness as free improvisation\, but with a keen awareness of power relations and commitment to form.\nZosha Warpeha\nis a Brooklyn-based composer-performer working in a meditative space at the intersection of contemporary improvisation and folk traditions. Using bowed stringed instruments alongside her own voice\, her long-form compositions explore transformations of time\, tonality\, and resonant space. She performs primarily on Hardanger d’amore\, a sympathetic-stringed instrument closely related to the Norwegian Hardanger fiddle. While her work is informed by the cyclical forms and physical momentum of Nordic folk music\, her solo practice “subvert[s] tradition not as a political act\, but as a point of departure” (Peter Margasak\, Nowhere Street).\nShe was a 2025 artist-in-residence at ISSUE Project Room and her work has also been supported by the US-Norway Fulbright Foundation\, Jerome Foundation\, and the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund. Her second solo album\,\nI grow accustomed to the dark\n\, will be released on Outside Time in early 2026.\nLeila Bordreuil\nis a French-American cellist\, composer and sound-artist based in Brooklyn\, NY. She accesses concepts as diverse as noise\, contemporary classical\, free jazz\, and experimental traditions but adheres to none of them. Her music mixes deep melancholia with harsh noise-walls at ear-bleeding levels\, and was described by The New York Times as “steadily scathing music\, favoring long and corrosive atonalities”.\nNava Dunkelman\nis a percussionist and improviser based in Brooklyn\, NY. Born in Tokyo\, Japan and raised in a multi-cultural environment by an American father and Indonesian mother. Her musical approach is innovative and dynamic\, combining virtuosity and intuition. Meticulous in an intrinsic way\, she uses her distinctive sound palette to explore and give life to a vast spectrum of musical possibilities.\nAnna Abondolo\nA native of California and based in Brooklyn\, Anna Abondolo is a multidisciplinary artist whose work spans music\, movement\, art\, and theater. A graduate from the New England Conservatory\, Anna studied bass performance with a concentration in music technology. Curious about individual experience\, her work investigates memory\, spatial environments\, and their relationship to the body. Anna uses a combination of traditional notation\, graphic scores\, and text\, writing for instrumental ensembles\, vocalists\, electronics\, song\, and bodies.\nWebb Crawford\nis a guitarist\, tenor banjoist\, and instrument-builder who works in free and structured improvisation. Their focus as a builder is in modern reinterpretations of historical stringed instruments\, and they have led instrument-building workshops at The Cooper Union\, Connecticut College\, and the Bennington Museum.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nExperimental duo perform a surreal protest of sound and spectacle warping 80s talk-show nostalgia into an eerie mirror of today.\n\nMiss America\nis the newest work from\nTalk Show\n\, the experimental duo featuring trumpeter\nSteph Richards\nand drummer/modular synthesist\nQasim Naqvi\n. Blending light\, video\, and theatrics\, Qas and Steph craft a dystopian protest that fuses music\, theater\, and ritual with irreverent humor. The work reflects on the absurdities and quiet horrors of 80s and 90s daytime television\, not as nostalgia\, but as prophecy\, revealing how its warped portrayals of the American psyche remain eerily relevant today. This east coast debut brings to life Talk Show’s forthcoming 2025 release on WeJazz Records.\nProjections of archival fragments from 1980s and 1990s talk shows such as Sally Jessy Raphael and Jerry Springer will be a backdrop as Steph’s trumpet resonates through drums and bowls of water and Qasim’s synthesizers and percussion build shifting\, hypnotic textures.\nMiss America\ninvites audiences into a shared act of witnessing\; part satire and part mirror of a strange theater of America.\nSteph Richards\ntrumpet and resonating surfaces\nQasim Naqvi\ndrums and modular synthesizer\nSteven Wendt\nlive video and puppeteering\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nTalk Show\nis a new duo collaboration featuring Steph Richards on trumpets and resonating surfaces and Qasim Naqvi on drums and modular synthesizer. Having worked together on other projects for almost two decades\, Talk Show marks their first\, pure duo collaboration – a space to engage with a sonic language they’ve been cultivating together for years. The ensemble features Naqvi crafting real-time electronics and drum set work\, and Richards using trumpets and resonating percussion to summon sympathetic vibrations and otherworldly sounds through timpani\, snare and water.\nSharing an appetite for experimentalism\, theatricality and irreverent collisions of sound and image\, Qasim and Steph met in 2008 at CalArts\, which was a breeding ground for open creative thought and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Often working with directors in the theater program\, choreographers\, or experimental and character animators\, Steph and Qasim’s musical language has a rooting in visual performance art. From their first premiere\, costumed together inside a giant two-person dress sculpture that consumed a drum set\, to their most recent 2025 audio visual nightmare which explores the horrors of 80s daytime reality talk shows\, this duo presents a voice of the grimy and the grotesque: a new beauty of questionable acts and character flaws in sound\nSteven Wendt\nis a versatile performer\, puppeteer\, and devised theater creator with decades of experience in immersive performance art. Known for his work with Blue Man Group and innovative hand shadow puppetry\, Wendt has collaborated on groundbreaking multimedia productions such as THIS & THAT. His artistry spans acting\, music\, puppetry\, and visual arts\, earning him recognition through prestigious awards for innovation and excellence in theatrical effects.\nWendt’s video feedback performance is a dynamic interplay of light and time—a modern cave painting illuminated by projection. Using two vintage Sony camcorders and no computer effects\, the work explores infinite visual recursion reminiscent of facing mirrors\, where each subtle crank of the tripod or zoom becomes an act of delicate fractal navigation. Its beauty lies in the difficulty to control it\, in the struggle to constrain what is fleeting\, boundless and evolving. Here the camera achieves strange consciousness\, turning its mechanical eye upon its own seeing\, revealing the hidden loop that has haunted our image-making since the first photograph fixed shadows onto silver two centuries ago.\nWendt received The Puppeteers of America – Jim Henson Award for Innovation (2023)

Emerging from\nStemeseder’s\nongoing personal interest in historic keyboard instruments and the repertoire composed for them\, the piece attempts to reconcile this fascination with his contemporary artistic practice and methods. Informed by research into the particular possibilities and constraints of Harpsichord temperaments with twelve notes per octave—and the aesthetic priorities that shaped their propagation—the work aims to deprioritize and deconstruct some of the goals these theories originally sought to accommodate.\nThe work is performed by the\nlongstanding producer-duo Stemeseder-Lil Injure\n(S-L) and an ensemble of plucked\, struck and electronic instruments\, continuing S-L’s interest in the juxtaposition of archaic sound-making tools and practices with contemporary technology.\nDoYeon Kim\ngayageum\nSimon Kanzler\ndigital signal processing\, sound spatialisation\nShakoor Hakeem\npercussion\nKris Chen Lil’Injure\ndrum set\, percussion\nElias\nStemeseder\nlautenwerk\, synthesizers\, samples\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.

Not only will this mark the first time the two projects will be featured together in a single evening\, the performance will come fresh off the release of\nAngel Fall\ns\, Courvoisier and Leo Smith’s very first duo album.\nSylvie Courvoisier (piano) and Mary Halvorson (guitar) will perform music from their latest release\,\nBone Bells\n(Pyroclastic Records\, March 2025).\nTheir third album as a duo and an eagerly awaited follow-up to 2021’s\nSearching for the Disappeared Hour\n\,\nBone Bells\npresents eight new intricate compositions: four by Sylvie and four by Mary. The duo’s telepathic interplay and ferocious intensity is on full display in this magical set of music.\nNext Courvoisier will be joined by trumpeter-composer Wadada Leo Smith to perform\nAngel Falls\n(Intakt Records\, October 3\, 2025). Leo Smith and  Courvoisier have collaborated for years\, with Courvoisier performing and recording in multiple Smith-led groups and Wadada’s unmistakable trumpet voice featured on Courvoisier’s electric\, atmospheric 2023 sextet album\nChimaera\n. Smith has been hailed by The New York Review of Books as one of the nation’s “most powerful storytellers\, an heir to American chroniclers like Charles Ives and Ornette Coleman.”\n“Sylvie Courvoisier and Mary Halvorson take their duo language to new heights of fluency and sophistication.” -Stewart Smith\, The Wire\nAt the crossroads of contemporary chamber music and post-jazz\, the pianist and the guitarist deepen a dialogue that\, with Bone Bells\, stands out as one of the most essential of our time… Bone Bells takes us through the thousand twists and turns of a strange and dreamlike universe — a striking blend of intelligence\, virtuosity\, and intuition. A truly outstanding record. — Stéphane Ollivier\, Jazz Magazine\n“There’s no comping\, no grandstanding\, only a constant sense of ongoing calibration\, oblique elements somehow poised in the perfect balance. How do they do it? I’m reminded of something the painter George Braque once said: “The only valid thing in art is that which cannot be explained. If there is no mystery then there is no ‘poetry’\, the quality I value above all else in art.” -John Sharpe\nSylvie Courvoisier\npiano\, composition\nMary Halvorson\nguitar\, composition\nWadada Leo Smith\ntrumpet\, composition\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nPianist-composer\nSylvie Courvoisier\n\, a Brooklyn-based native of Switzerland and winner of the Swiss Grand Prix and The American Academy of Arts and Letters Music Award in 2025\, has earned renown for balancing two distinct worlds: the deep\, richly detailed chamber music of her European roots and the grooving\, hook-laden sounds of the avant-jazz scene in New York City\, her home for more than two decades. Few artists feel truly at ease in both concert halls and jazz clubs\, playing improvised or composed music. But Courvoisier — “a pianist of equal parts audacity and poise\,” according to The New York Times — is as compelling when performing Stravinsky’s epochal Rite of Spring in league with new-music pianist Cory Smythe as she is when improvising with her own acclaimed jazz trio\, featuring bassist Drew Gress and drummer Kenny Wollesen or in solo. In music as in life\, Courvoisier crosses borders with a creative spirit and a free mind\; her music-making is as playful as it is intense\, as steeped in tradition as it is questing and intrepid. NPR’s Kevin Whitehead has encapsulated her art in an evocative way: “Some pianists approach the instrument like it’s a cathedral. Sylvie Courvoisier treats it like a playground.”\nGuitarist\, composer and MacArthur Fellow\nMary Halvorson\nhas been called “NYC’s least-predictable improviser” (Howard Mandel\, City Arts)\, “the most forward-thinking guitarist working right now” (Lars Gotrich\, NPR.org)\, and “one of today’s most formidable bandleaders” (Francis Davis\, Village Voice).\nWadada Leo Smith\nis a highly acclaimed American trumpeter\, composer\, and improviser known for his innovative approach to music. His work\, often categorized as “creative music\,” spans various genres and includes explorations of diverse musical cultures. He’s recognized for his unique Ankhrasmation system of notation and his powerful\, socially conscious compositions\, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Ten Freedom Summers

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nA suite of spectral works for two contrabass clarinets followed by minimalist pipe organ explorations.\n\nSound artist and composer\nFUJI||||||||||TA\nshares his latest work on the pipe organ\,\nopened by contrabass clarinet duo\,\nJohn McCowen & Madison Greenstone\n.\nFUJI||||||||||TA\n’s\nlatest set\,\nA School of Sardines in the Pipe\nis a minimalist exploration of airwaves using just two organ pipes and an airbrush. While it marks a clear departure from his previous drone-approach\, his commitment to acoustic sonic expression remains intact\, and now pushed even further toward an extreme and highly personal style.\nJohn McCowen & Madison Greenstone\nhave been working together as a clarinet duo since 2016—exclusively performing John McCowen’s\nMundanas\nworks.\nMundanas VII-XI\n(Mengi Records\, Winter 2025) is a work inspired by the earthquake vibrations preceding the Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption of March 2021 near John’s home in Reykjavík\, Iceland where he recorded the demos for the album in his basement studio. For John\, the earthquake’s rolling vibrations unconsciously shaped the music of\nMundanas VII-XI\,\nas recording was interrupted by a persistent pulse for weeks leading up to the eruption. The incredibly low\, sine-like tone of the earthquakes created an incredible ever-increasing\, visceral vibration. The parallels between this experience and the music are unambiguous — two contrabass clarinets emanating low\, sine-like tones with shifting harmonics activated by these rumbling swells\, emerging a wave of combinatorial frequencies — an acoustic stream of almost tactile sound.\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nFUJI||||||||||TA\nis a sound artist and composer based in Japan. He creates unique sound art and music as an extension of his interest in wanting to hear unknown sounds and noises. In 2009 Fujita hand fabricated an original instrument\, a pipe organ. Since then\, he has released a number of different minimal sets where the sound of air is used as a common thread.\nThe release of his 2020 album\niki\non Swiss label Hallow Ground led to wider recognition beyond Japan\, particularly in Europe and North America. Since then\, he has performed in a wide range of venues and festivals internationally.\nWhen he build his pipe organ\, he had no knowledge of the experimental organ scenes in Europe\, North America\, or any other context. It was precisely this lack of awareness that gave rise to his unique approach one that emerged from a personal and intuitive place\, outside of any established musical context. This approach remains central to his practice today\, as he continues to prioritize personal exploration and curiosity over convention\, pursuing a highly individual style and a deep commitment to his own sonic sensibilities.\nHis works have been presented at Unsound Festival(PL)\, Rewire Festival(NL)\, Big Ears Festival(US)\, Send+Receive(CA)\, Variations Festival(FR)\, Volume Festival(AUS)\,  MODE(UK)\, Waking Life(PT)\, Bourse de Commerce(FR)\, Pioneer Works(US)\, and more.\nFUJI||||||||||TA’s body of work also features collaborations with\n∈Ｙ∋ (Boredoms)\, Keiji Haino\, Rashad Becker and others.\nHis albums are “iki” [Hallow Ground]\, “KŌMORI” [Boomkat Editions]\, “NOISEEM” [33-33]\,\n“MMM” [Hallow Ground]\n.\nJohn McCowen’s\nmusical life is rooted in an obsession with discovering a polyphonic language on a historically monophonic instrument — the clarinet. This has led him to a unique acoustic vocabulary that is akin to a shifting soundscape of electronic feedback. John’s multiphonic approach embraces drones\, difference/combinatorial tones\, and beating harmonics as a means to showcase the compositional potential within a single\, acoustic sound source. His work has been described by The New Yorker as “the sonic equivalent of microscopic life viewed on a slide” and “an astonishing demonstration of pure sound and human will” by The Wire. Recorded documents of this practice have been released by Edition Wandelweiser\, International Anthem\, Astral Spirits\, Dinzu Artefacts\, Superpang\, and others. John has been Artist-in-Residence at Headlands Center for the Arts\, ISSUE Project Room\, & Lijiang Studio. John has collaborated extensively with the founder of The Art Ensemble of Chicago and Roscoe Mitchell (member of Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). He has orchestrated\, arranged\, and transcribed Mitchell’s works for orchestras and other ensembles\, as well as performing as a duo of bass saxophone and contrabass clarinet.\nMadison Greenstone\nis a clarinetist\, writer\, and composer based in Brooklyn known for their ‘revelatory’ (Pitchfork) performances. Their solo practice exstatic resonances explores ‘shatteringly intense’ (Nowhere Street) instrumental expressions that give rise to a ‘thrilling rawness’ (The Wire) as the clarinet is treated as a site of generative instability. Exstatic resonances draw on ongoing studies in phenomenology\, self-generative music\, Jewish mysticism\, and acoustics. Their approach embraces and instigates chaotic timbral actions\, difficult-to-reign sonorities\, and harmonically rich and noisy resonances that have a vivid inner life and movement.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nJoined by a 10-piece ensemble\, the vibraphonist celebrates her new Pyroclastic release\, exploring celestial shapes and musical structures.\n\nVibraphonist\, marimbist\, and composer\nPatricia Brennan\ncelebrates her album\nOf The Near And Far\non Pyroclastic Records (out October 24\, 2025).\nBrennan draws deep inspiration from astronomy\, blending music with cosmic observation. Fueled by her lifelong fascination with constellations and geometrical patterns in the sky\, Brennan superimposed celestial shapes onto musical structures to craft the album’s harmonic and melodic content. Composed during her 2024 Jazz Gallery Residency Commission\n\,\nthe album builds on her acclaimed 2024 release\nBreaking Stretch\nand expands her creative scope by incorporating her classical training\, electronic experimentation\, and love for 1990s alt-rock. Featuring a ten-piece ensemble that merges jazz\, string quartet\, and electro-acoustic elements\, Brennan constructs compositions that defy categorization\, with string writing inspired by classical composers\, alongside avant-garde textures rooted in contemporary chamber and percussion music.\nThematically\,\nOf The Near and Far\ntraverses myth\, science\, and emotion. Each piece is tied to a specific constellation or astronomical idea — like “Andromeda\,” which reflects mythic drama and galactic chaos\, or “Antlia\,” which depicts mechanical precision. Brennan’s approach balances intellectual design with instinctive musicality\, ensuring emotional resonance within her conceptual frameworks. Ultimately\, Brennan sees this project as a personal and artistic attempt to connect her inner world of sound with the infinite universe\, affirming a shared origin and destiny between humanity and the stars.\n“The jazz world can get stuck in a battle between the head and the heart\, but rarely do you find an improviser like Patricia Brennan [whose] music seems to exist in a realm outside the body\, but stays loaded with feeling.” –The New York Times\nModney\nviolin\nPala Garcia\nviolin\nKyle Armbrust\nviola\nMichael Nicolas\ncello\nSylvie Courvoisier\npiano\nMiles Okazaki\nguitar\nKim Cass\nbass\nJohn Hollenbeck\ndrums\nArktureye\nelectronics\nPatricia Brennan\nvibraphone with electronics\, compositions\nEli Greenhoe\nconductor\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nVibraphonist\, marimbist\, improviser and composer\nPatricia Brennan\n“has been widely feted as one of the instrument’s newer leaders\,” observed The New York City Jazz Record.

Co-leaders Anna Webber and Angela Morris compose vital\, innovative repertoire that incorporates a jazz lineage with the extended techniques of modern improvisers and the compositional breadth of new music. Performances celebrate the unique current of jazz musicians in Brooklyn\, as fluent in exacting notated music as a variety of improvisational languages. As a female-directed ensemble\, the Webber/Morris Big Band heralds the normalization of women as bandleaders and composers and empowers girls and women in music through diverse workshops and concerts.\nAnna Webber\nis a flutist\, saxophonist\, and composer whose interests and work live in the overlap between avant-garde jazz and new classical music. Her new album\,\nShimmer Wince\n\, explores Just Intonation in a jazz setting\, and is a follow-up to her critically-acclaimed release\nIdiom\n. That album earned Webber the accolade of being named the top composer of the year by JazzTimes in 2021. Her music has been called “visionary and captivating\,” (Wall Street Journal)\, and “heady music [that] appeals to the rest of the body” (NPR). Her album\nClockwise\nwas voted #6 Best Album of 2019 in the NPR Jazz Critics Poll\, and she was recently named a 2021 Berlin Prize Fellow and 2024 Herb Alpert Award in the Arts Fellow. Webber is a 2018 Guggenheim Fellow. She has additionally been honored with the Margaret Whitton Award (administered by the Jazz Gallery)\; grants from the Shifting Foundation (2015)\, the New York Foundation for the Arts (2017)\, the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec\, and the Canada Council for the Arts\; and residencies from Exploring the Metropolis (2019)\, the MacDowell Colony (2017 & 2020)\, the Millay Colony for the Arts (2015)\, and the Brush Creek Foundation for the Arts (2014). Webber is originally from British Columbia.\nIf Brooklyn’s music circles draw a venn diagram\,\nAngela Morris\nthrives in the loop between avant-jazz\, new music\, and pop. A composer and multi-instrumentalist\, (known mostly as saxophonist\, she grew up playing violin) she has performed throughout North America and Europe everywhere from basements to arenas. Her compositions premiered by cellist Leo Eguchi and percussionist Chris Froh\, violinist Monica Davis\, and the Nouveau Classical Project. She has been commissioned by WDR Big Band\, Dartmouth College\, and the Brooklyn Youth Music Project. Morris is a member of several active collaborative ensembles\, including Skellettes\, Motel\, and TMT Trio. Morris has organized the multi-disciplinary\, experimental concert series Brackish – music & art since 2015\, which has produced dozens of concerts in Brooklyn and four online film festivals.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nComposer of the acclaimed Odesa Suite premieres new work\, out on John Zorn's Tzadik label\, feat. Pauline Kim Harris\, Celia Hatton\, and Andrew […]\n\nPianist and composer\nVadim Neselovskyi\n—praised by The New York Times for his “finely wrought detail and glinting elegance\,” recognized by The Guardian for his “extraordinary playing\,” and described by All About Jazz as “a composer who blends form and freedom in new ways”—presents\nPerseverantia\n\, a powerful suite for piano and string trio.\nAs a Ukrainian artist\, Neselovskyi brings profound emotional depth to this work\, which reflects on compassion\, resilience\, and the endurance of the human spirit. While inspired by the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine\,\nPerseverantia\ntranscends politics—it is a universal meditation on courage and hope in times of struggle.\nMusically\, the piece bridges worlds: blending the lyricism of Eastern European folk traditions with post-war avant-garde textures\, minimalistic patterns\, and metal-influenced grooves. The result is a sound world that is both intimate and explosive\, architectural yet deeply emotional.\nThe recording—executive produced by John Zorn—will be released on Tzadik Records on February 24\, 2026. For his Roulette performance\, Neselovskyi teams up with leading figures of New York’s contemporary music scene: violinist\nPauline Kim Harris\n\, violist\nCelia Hatton\n\, and cellist\nAndrew Janss\n.\nPauline Kim\nHarris violin\nCelia Hatton\nviola\nAndrew Janss\ncello\nVadim Neselovskyi\npiano\, composition\n“Placing exhilarating piano improvisations in the context of gorgeous compositions for classical string trio\,\nPerseverantia\nis Vadim’s greatest work to date.” –Tzadik Records\n“\nVadim\nNeselovskyi’s … pianism shares the qualities of a sculpture carved in ice: finely wrought detail\, sharply traced\; glinting elegance\; coolness to the touch\; refractions of light. His right and left hands converse with each other in eager\, enchanted dialogue.” –The New York Times\nNeselovskyi’s background is as multifaceted as his music. Born in Odesa\, trained in Germany\, and now based in Boston—where he serves as a professor at Berklee College of Music and MIT—he has forged a career bridging genres and continents. His collaborators include Gary Burton\, John Zorn\, Arkady Shilkloper\, and Julian Lage\, among others. His previous album\,\nOdesa\n\, was named one of The Boston Globe’s Best Albums of 2022 and featured by The New York Times as one of the “Five Classical Albums You Can Check Out Now.”\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nAs a young composer and pianist growing up in Odesa\, Ukraine\,\nVadim Neselovskyi\ndiscovered that his calling was not to follow any one stylistic path but to become a “creator of music.” He’s long since fulfilled that early promise in myriad ways both inventive and unexpected: as a composer whose vision is expansive enough to spark inspired interpretations from jazz trio and symphony orchestra alike\; as an improviser carving surprising pathways through the straight ahead\, the avant-garde\, and the indefinable\; and as a collaborator valued by peers\, mentors and fellow innovators.\nThe\nLos Angeles Times\nhas praised Neselovskyi’s “extraordinary playing” while\nThe Guardian\n(UK) called him “the most promising of the young improvisers.” Whether as a pianist\, composer\, improviser\, soloist or bandleader\, Neselovskyi creates music that is truly inspired and wholly unique. His work has been played by jazz greats like\nRandy Brecker\n\,\nAntonio Sanchez\n\,\nJulian Lage\n\, and\nGary Burton\n\, as well as classical artists (\nDaniel Gauthier\n\, whose recording of Neselovskyi’s “San Felio” won an ECHO Classical Award) and symphony orchestras in the United States and Europe.\nThose diverse talents have attracted the attention of revered artists crossing the boundaries of genre\, including legendary vibraphonist\nGary Burton\n\, who famously enlisted Neselovskyi for his acclaimed Generations Quintet\; the prestigious Graz Philharmoniker\, which performed his composition “Prelude for Vibes” on their New Year’s program\; iconoclastic composer/saxophonist\nJohn Zorn\n\, who invited Neselovskyi to contribute to\nThe Book Beriah\n\, the final installment of his Masada project\; and French horn/alphorn pioneer\nArkady Shilkloper\n\, a profound influence with whom the pianist now shares a longstanding duo collaboration.\nIn 2022\, he paid tribute to his hometown with\nOdesa\n\, a ruminative and poetic solo piano album featuring compositions inspired by Ukrainian landmarks like the Odesa Railway Station\, Potemkin Stairs\, and Odesa Conservatory. The New York Times classical critic Seth Colter Walls recently featured\nOdesa\nin “5 CLASSICAL ALBUMS YOU CAN LISTEN TO RIGHT NOW”. Additionally the album has had recent media hits on NPR Morning Edition\, WNYC’s All of It with Alison Stewart\, The PBS Newshour\, The Boston Globe and many others all over Germany\, Spain\, France\, the U.K. and elsewhere.

Opening the evening is a set by experimental pedal steel guitarist and Lobby Art Editions co label head\nSam Wenc\n\, with collaborators\, to premiere his latest album\nLanguage At An Angle\n.\nDebuting in January 2024 the Shaker Ensemble is shepherded by a trust based composition within the framing of the phasing\, audio-hallucinatory playing of the maracas. Born out of a need for healing and self soothing\, the ensemble has grown into a participatory event that incudes the audience and architecture of every building it presents in.\nRyan Sawyer Shaker Ensemble\nRyan Sawyer\nmaracas\, voice\nLaura Cocks\nflutes\, voice\nisa crespo pardo\nvoice\nNate Wooley\ntrumpet\, voice\nJessica Pavone\nviola\, voice\nHenry Fraser\nbass\, voice\nMadison Greenstone\nclarinets\, voice\nFrom\nLanguage At An Angle\nliner notes\, by Jack Braunstein:\n“Language At An Angle” is the latest offering from\nSam Wenc\n(fka Post Moves)\; an eight-part tone poem and journey through the heart\, and\, as the title suggests\, a reflection on meaning itself. Fleshed out with a crew of wildly talented improvisor-composers\, the music sits in a unique place at the edges of free-improvisation\, East Asian court music\, and the overtone-centered wizardry of drone technicians like Ellen Fullman and Kali Malone.\nThis performance will be the premiere of this material in large ensemble format after a year of solo performances that took Sam from Arizona to Japan. The music retains the intensity of its original form while only revealing more deeply the intricacies of its textural and melodic accomplishments. As an expression of states encountered through Wenc’s extended engagements with long durations of sitting meditation\, it is a truthful and profoundly beautiful record. As a fully-realized album from one of the best avant-garde pedal steel players in the game with 13 years of sound exploration and technique development under his belt\, it’s monumental.\nCompositionally and spiritually\, there is no greater influence on this record than the late Susan Alcorn\, to whom the album is dedicated. Like all of those who had the privilege to be taught by Susan\, Wenc was transformed by her presence and generosity. While her boundless creativity and fierce technical ability on the instrument are a treasure to all open-minded steel players\, what I understand Sam to treasure most about her mentorship were the more intangible things–the wholeness of spirit that she brought to her playing and relationships\, and her sensitivities to the spiritual forces of the world. Susan’s passing was a devastating loss for her community: there are some transformations for which you can’t prepare. What Language at an Angle offers instead is a practice of making meaning in this world\, tenuously\, temporarily\, as it is\, deeply. And in doing so\, he is passing on a gift. Ready or not\, we might need it.\n“The singular music of pedal steel guitarist\, Sam Wenc…takes an instrument that is usually associated in a cliche way and turns it into something very atmospheric and expansive” – WNYC\nSam Wenc + Friends\nSam Wenc\npedal steel\nSam Yulsman\npiano\nJoey Sullivan\ndrums\nJohn Moran\nbass\nVictor Vieira Branco\nvibraphone\nWill Henriksen\nviolin\nMatthew Lee\nbass clarinet/saxophone\nJack Braunstein\nclarinet\nisabel crespo pardo\nvocals\nBorn in 1976 in San Antonio\, Texas\,\nRyan Sawyer\nstarted playing drums at 11\, learning his craft through an early exposure to not only rock and jazz but also the colloquial conjunto\, zydeco\, and punk rock musics of his home town. He moved to New York in 1997 to pursue his interest in improvised music.\nYears of peerage in underground and jazz scenes with enormously high-grade collaborators has informed Ryan’s performance and arrangements\, helping to shape the output of a supremely talented musician into a rare channel of vast textures\, dynamics and moods formed from drumkit alone. Ryan has played alongside Marshall Allen\, Boredoms\, Thurston Moore\, TV On The Radio\, Charles Gayle\, Nate Wooley\, Rhys Chatham among countless others.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nNew “Jazztronica” compositions inspired by electronic music techniques and UK drum ‘n’ bass\, electro\, and hip-hop.\n\nAaron Burnett\nand his quintet\nthe Big Machine\nreturn to Roulette with new “Jazztronica”compositions inspired by electronic music techniques and sounds from his own long-standing fascination with UK drum ‘n’ bass\, electro\, and hip hop. The band will be paying homage to a classic period in drum ’n’ bass history in which jungle\, drum ‘n’ bass and intelligent / ambient drum ‘n’ bass were all being created in a vibrant co-existent space. Big Machine will also incorporate elements of modern hip hop\, drill music and trap as well providing an elaborate soundscape for the audience. Collectively the band will emulate\, and enhance\, that complex sound-field of machine-based music with jazz improvisation and techniques. But it’s important to note that this isn’t a jazz over drum ‘n’ bass beats set – it’s new material that evolves from elements of machine-produced music\, with those sounds in turn allowing Aaron’s quintet to soar and transcend genre-boundaries. Considering Aaron has performed on two Grammy winning albums\, and has been exploring the zone he calls ‘Jazztronica’ for a good while now\, we can assume that his goal of creating new ‘future music’ sonic atmospheres will be successful.

However Aaron Burnett is gaining momentum as his own entity.  As the primary composer for his band Aaron Burnett and The Big Machine\, Aaron’s music has been referred to as\, “navigating the crevices and passageways between musical dimensions.” (Philip Booth\, Jazziz Magazine\, March\, 2021) Aaron’s interest in technology has also led him to establish Sistine Criminals\, a live electronic band that plays trap\, hip hop\, R&B\, and creates studio backing tracks for artists.\nPeter Evans\nis a composer\, trumpet player\, bandleader and educator based in New York City.  For 20 years Evans has been pushing the boundaries of creative music in formats as divergent as solo trumpet improvisation\, symphony orchestras\, jazz ensembles\, noise/electronic music\, and through-composed works. He’s been the recipient of awards and commissions worldwide including the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 2022. He’s released 20 albums of original music including the critically acclaimed Ghosts\, Lifeblood and Being & Becoming. A prolific composer and performer\, Evans tours regularly with his groups Being & Becoming\, SYMPHONY\, Forever 21\, as a soloist and as a collaborator with some of the leading lights of modern music.\nCarlos Homs\nis a New York–based pianist\, composer\, and producer whose work spans jazz\, hip‑hop\, and electronic music.

Through five historical case studies—chapters on early cybernetic electronic systems developed by Morton Subotnick\, Donald Buchla\, Pauline Oliveros\, Alvin Lucier\, and Sun Ra—Gordon’s book develops a concept of “ex-composition” that accounts for experiences of playing with instruments that play themselves\, and the consequences those experiences hold for understanding the musical self in an increasingly informational world.\nAfter a panel discussion and Q&A\, Gordon will be joined by frequent collaborator\nMarcia Bassett\n(electronics)\, as well as\nKeith Fullerton Whitman\n(electronics)\, and\nLuke Stewart\n(bass) for improvised performances that build on the conversation in solo and duo formations.\nTed Gordon\nauthor\, Buchla Music Easel\nMarcia Bassett\npanelist\, Buchla Music Easel\nKeith Fullerton\nWhitman\npanelist\, electronics\nLuke Stewart\npanelist\, bass\n“How can information systems make music?

Read it\, and you’ll never hear a synthesizer quite the same way again.”—Fred Turner\, author of\nThe Democratic Surround: Multimedia and American Liberalism from World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties\n“Gordon tells five compelling stories of musical creativity and cybernetics in the Information Age. But this is not a tale of technological determinism.\nThe Composer’s Black Box\nshows us not how music was shaped by oscillators\, circuit boards\, and voltage controls but how deeply all of this depended on the imaginations of the people who used these technologies\, their diverse notions of agency\, and\, ultimately\, their visions of freedom and control.”—Emily I. Dolan\, author of\nThe Orchestral Revolution: Haydn and the Technologies of Timbre\n“At last we have a detailed\, sophisticated history of the impact cybernetic thinking had on the music of the 1960s\, 1970s\, and beyond. Gordon’s book represents an important intervention into postwar music history—one that is as urgent as ever\, given cybernetics’ role in laying the groundwork for contemporary digital culture.”—Eric Drott\, author of\nStreaming Music\, Streaming Capital\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nTed Gordon\nis Assistant Professor of Music at Baruch College and the Graduate Center\, City University of New York.

The piece bridges two spatial sound mixes played by remote performers\, transmitted to each other in real-time via web-app developed by Martinez. Material used in the performance consists of guitar and environmental recordings made in Los Angeles and New York City\, shaped by compression artifacts and the natural time-delay incurred through transmission.\nSydney Spann\nwill perform new solo music for voice and electronics.\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nTommy\nMartinez\nis an artist and programmer working through research\, sound and code. He creates software and musical systems for the internet\, custom electronics\, and for live multichannel performance. His work often engages network technologies and infrastructure to create generative and improvised sound works in emerging mediums. He has performed music at MoMA PS1\, Fridman Gallery\, Rhizome\, and Pioneer Works\, and currently teaches sound and electronic media art at NYU and Columbia University.\nJazmin “Jazzy” Romero\nis an artist from Los Angeles\, California. Her work explores how memory is embodied through performance\, video\, sound\, and sculpture. Romero’s practice considers experimentation\, improvisation\, and collaboration as pathways for alternative forms of storytelling. She engages with the relationship between musical gesture and physical form to produce scores\, assemblages\, and compositions. She is also a member of various performance and music production collectives\, such as COQUETA.\nSydney Spann\n\, originally from Baltimore\, MD\, is a musician based in New York. They work with synthesis\, electronics\, amateur acoustic instrumentation and voice to make studio compositions and live performances.

The annual event features Niblock’s iconic multimedia performance style: multiple projections\, mainly of his major film work\nThe Movement of People Working\n(1973-1991)\n\, soundtracked by compositions spanning his over 50 year career.\nThe Movement of People Working\nis a documentary collection of multiple short videos with minimalist editing\, focused on people in their daily activities and tasks of manual labor\, including hammering\, sewing\, weaving\, raking\, harvesting\, dyeing\, fishing\, and more—featuring over 25 hours of mostly 16 mm footage from Peru\, Mexico\, Hungary\, Hong Kong\, Brazil\, Lesotho\, Portugal\, China\, Japan\, Sumatra\, and the Arctic. Accompanied by Niblock’s droning compositions\, the piece is both visually and sonically immersive\, with a rhythmic and unbroken structure.\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nPhill Niblock\n(1933-2024\, USA) was an artist whose fifty-year career spanned minimalist and experimental music\, film\, and photography. Since 1985\, he served as director of Experimental Intermedia\, a foundation for avant-garde music based in New York with a branch in Ghent\, and curator of the foundation’s record label XI. Known for his thick\, loud drones of music\, Niblock’s signature sound is filled with microtones of instrumental timbres that generate many other tones in the performance space. In 2013\, his diverse artistic career was the subject of a retrospective realized in partnership between Circuit (Contemporary Art Centre Lausanne) and Musée de l’Elysée. The following year Niblock was honored with the prestigious Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award.
