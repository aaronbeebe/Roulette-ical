DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nA suite of spectral works for two contrabass clarinets followed by minimalist pipe organ explorations.\n\nSound artist and composer\nFUJI||||||||||TA\nshares his latest work on the pipe organ\,\nopened by contrabass clarinet duo\,\nJohn McCowen & Madison Greenstone\n.\nFUJI||||||||||TA\n’s\nlatest set\,\nA School of Sardines in the Pipe\nis a minimalist exploration of airwaves using just two organ pipes and an airbrush. While it marks a clear departure from his previous drone-approach\, his commitment to acoustic sonic expression remains intact\, and now pushed even further toward an extreme and highly personal style.\nJohn McCowen & Madison Greenstone\nhave been working together as a clarinet duo since 2016—exclusively performing John McCowen’s\nMundanas\nworks.\nMundanas VII-XI\n(Mengi Records\, Winter 2025) is a work inspired by the earthquake vibrations preceding the Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption of March 2021 near John’s home in Reykjavík\, Iceland where he recorded the demos for the album in his basement studio. For John\, the earthquake’s rolling vibrations unconsciously shaped the music of\nMundanas VII-XI\,\nas recording was interrupted by a persistent pulse for weeks leading up to the eruption. The incredibly low\, sine-like tone of the earthquakes created an incredible ever-increasing\, visceral vibration. The parallels between this experience and the music are unambiguous — two contrabass clarinets emanating low\, sine-like tones with shifting harmonics activated by these rumbling swells\, emerging a wave of combinatorial frequencies — an acoustic stream of almost tactile sound.\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nFUJI||||||||||TA\nis a sound artist and composer based in Japan. He creates unique sound art and music as an extension of his interest in wanting to hear unknown sounds and noises. In 2009 Fujita hand fabricated an original instrument\, a pipe organ. Since then\, he has released a number of different minimal sets where the sound of air is used as a common thread.\nThe release of his 2020 album\niki\non Swiss label Hallow Ground led to wider recognition beyond Japan\, particularly in Europe and North America. Since then\, he has performed in a wide range of venues and festivals internationally.\nWhen he build his pipe organ\, he had no knowledge of the experimental organ scenes in Europe\, North America\, or any other context. It was precisely this lack of awareness that gave rise to his unique approach one that emerged from a personal and intuitive place\, outside of any established musical context. This approach remains central to his practice today\, as he continues to prioritize personal exploration and curiosity over convention\, pursuing a highly individual style and a deep commitment to his own sonic sensibilities.\nHis works have been presented at Unsound Festival(PL)\, Rewire Festival(NL)\, Big Ears Festival(US)\, Send+Receive(CA)\, Variations Festival(FR)\, Volume Festival(AUS)\,  MODE(UK)\, Waking Life(PT)\, Bourse de Commerce(FR)\, Pioneer Works(US)\, and more.\nFUJI||||||||||TA’s body of work also features collaborations with\n∈Ｙ∋ (Boredoms)\, Keiji Haino\, Rashad Becker and others.\nHis albums are “iki” [Hallow Ground]\, “KŌMORI” [Boomkat Editions]\, “NOISEEM” [33-33]\,\n“MMM” [Hallow Ground]\n.\nJohn McCowen’s\nmusical life is rooted in an obsession with discovering a polyphonic language on a historically monophonic instrument — the clarinet. This has led him to a unique acoustic vocabulary that is akin to a shifting soundscape of electronic feedback. John’s multiphonic approach embraces drones\, difference/combinatorial tones\, and beating harmonics as a means to showcase the compositional potential within a single\, acoustic sound source. His work has been described by The New Yorker as “the sonic equivalent of microscopic life viewed on a slide” and “an astonishing demonstration of pure sound and human will” by The Wire. Recorded documents of this practice have been released by Edition Wandelweiser\, International Anthem\, Astral Spirits\, Dinzu Artefacts\, Superpang\, and others. John has been Artist-in-Residence at Headlands Center for the Arts\, ISSUE Project Room\, & Lijiang Studio. John has collaborated extensively with the founder of The Art Ensemble of Chicago and Roscoe Mitchell (member of Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). He has orchestrated\, arranged\, and transcribed Mitchell’s works for orchestras and other ensembles\, as well as performing as a duo of bass saxophone and contrabass clarinet.\nMadison Greenstone\nis a clarinetist\, writer\, and composer based in Brooklyn known for their ‘revelatory’ (Pitchfork) performances. Their solo practice exstatic resonances explores ‘shatteringly intense’ (Nowhere Street) instrumental expressions that give rise to a ‘thrilling rawness’ (The Wire) as the clarinet is treated as a site of generative instability. Exstatic resonances draw on ongoing studies in phenomenology\, self-generative music\, Jewish mysticism\, and acoustics. Their approach embraces and instigates chaotic timbral actions\, difficult-to-reign sonorities\, and harmonically rich and noisy resonances that have a vivid inner life and movement.

Al-Saadi (b.1958\, Iraq)\, is the only living singer who has mastered the entire Iraqi Maqam repertoire. Inscribed on UNESCO’s Intangible Heritage list\, the Iraqi Maqam is a repertoire of long-form compositions of sung poetry that has been passed down orally for generations. Al-Saadi’s\nMaqam Al-Iraq\n(Maqām) is the first Iraqi Maqam release by any artist in over a decade.\nAmir ElSaffar’s New Quartet is a meeting between ElSaffar’s longstanding collaborators\,\nTomas Fujiwara\nand\nOle Mathisen\n\, and Greek pianist\nTania Giannouli (U.S. Premiere)\n. The four musicians came together in 2023 in one of Europe’s best sounding halls\, the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin. The magic and intuitive ease between the musicians was riveting and powerful\, bringing ElSaffar’s unique microtonal compositions to new heights. The recording of that performance will be released on Maqām Records in November 2025. Giannouli\, who plays a microtonal piano in the quartet\, is one of Europe’s fastest rising stars\, performing at all the major jazz festivals and concert halls. This concert marks her first time taking the stage in the U.S.\, as well as the group’s U.S. premiere.\nSet 1\nHamid Al-Saadi\nmaqam vocal\nDena El Saffar\nviolin and joza\nTim Moore\npercussion\nSet 2\nAmir ElSaffar\nsantur\, trumpet\nTomas Fujiwara\ndrums\nOle Mathisen\ntenor saxophone\nTania Giannouli\npiano\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nMaqām Records\nserves as the creative publishing arm of Maqam Studio\, a new initiative founded by trumpeter\, santur player\, vocalist\, and composer\nAmir ElSaffar\n.

The label focuses on creating high-quality recordings that document traditional maqam repertoire while creating innovative interpretations through new commissions and collaborations. Building on the foundation of releasing works by master practitioners like Hamid Al-Saadi and Amir ElSaffar\, we are expanding to showcase emerging artists from Iraq and the broader Middle East\, while supporting publishing of new creative works coming from Maqam Studio\, including new works from the artist Residency and Commissions programs. Maqam Records contributes to both preservation and innovation inspired by the tradition.

Not only will this mark the first time the two projects will be featured together in a single evening\, the performance will come fresh off the release of\nAngel Fall\ns\, Courvoisier and Leo Smith’s very first duo album.\nSylvie Courvoisier (piano) and Mary Halvorson (guitar) will perform music from their latest release\,\nBone Bells\n(Pyroclastic Records\, March 2025).\nTheir third album as a duo and an eagerly awaited follow-up to 2021’s\nSearching for the Disappeared Hour\n\,\nBone Bells\npresents eight new intricate compositions: four by Sylvie and four by Mary. The duo’s telepathic interplay and ferocious intensity is on full display in this magical set of music.\nNext Courvoisier will be joined by trumpeter-composer Wadada Leo Smith to perform\nAngel Falls\n(Intakt Records\, October 3\, 2025). Leo Smith and  Courvoisier have collaborated for years\, with Courvoisier performing and recording in multiple Smith-led groups and Wadada’s unmistakable trumpet voice featured on Courvoisier’s electric\, atmospheric 2023 sextet album\nChimaera\n. Smith has been hailed by The New York Review of Books as one of the nation’s “most powerful storytellers\, an heir to American chroniclers like Charles Ives and Ornette Coleman.”\n“Sylvie Courvoisier and Mary Halvorson take their duo language to new heights of fluency and sophistication.” -Stewart Smith\, The Wire\nAt the crossroads of contemporary chamber music and post-jazz\, the pianist and the guitarist deepen a dialogue that\, with Bone Bells\, stands out as one of the most essential of our time… Bone Bells takes us through the thousand twists and turns of a strange and dreamlike universe — a striking blend of intelligence\, virtuosity\, and intuition. A truly outstanding record. — Stéphane Ollivier\, Jazz Magazine\n“There’s no comping\, no grandstanding\, only a constant sense of ongoing calibration\, oblique elements somehow poised in the perfect balance. How do they do it? I’m reminded of something the painter George Braque once said: “The only valid thing in art is that which cannot be explained. If there is no mystery then there is no ‘poetry’\, the quality I value above all else in art.” -John Sharpe\nSylvie Courvoisier\npiano\, composition\nMary Halvorson\nguitar\, composition\nWadada Leo Smith\ntrumpet\, composition\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nPianist-composer\nSylvie Courvoisier\n\, a Brooklyn-based native of Switzerland and winner of the Swiss Grand Prix and The American Academy of Arts and Letters Music Award in 2025\, has earned renown for balancing two distinct worlds: the deep\, richly detailed chamber music of her European roots and the grooving\, hook-laden sounds of the avant-jazz scene in New York City\, her home for more than two decades. Few artists feel truly at ease in both concert halls and jazz clubs\, playing improvised or composed music. But Courvoisier — “a pianist of equal parts audacity and poise\,” according to The New York Times — is as compelling when performing Stravinsky’s epochal Rite of Spring in league with new-music pianist Cory Smythe as she is when improvising with her own acclaimed jazz trio\, featuring bassist Drew Gress and drummer Kenny Wollesen or in solo. In music as in life\, Courvoisier crosses borders with a creative spirit and a free mind\; her music-making is as playful as it is intense\, as steeped in tradition as it is questing and intrepid. NPR’s Kevin Whitehead has encapsulated her art in an evocative way: “Some pianists approach the instrument like it’s a cathedral. Sylvie Courvoisier treats it like a playground.”\nGuitarist\, composer and MacArthur Fellow\nMary Halvorson\nhas been called “NYC’s least-predictable improviser” (Howard Mandel\, City Arts)\, “the most forward-thinking guitarist working right now” (Lars Gotrich\, NPR.org)\, and “one of today’s most formidable bandleaders” (Francis Davis\, Village Voice).\nWadada Leo Smith\nis a highly acclaimed American trumpeter\, composer\, and improviser known for his innovative approach to music. His work\, often categorized as “creative music\,” spans various genres and includes explorations of diverse musical cultures. He’s recognized for his unique Ankhrasmation system of notation and his powerful\, socially conscious compositions\, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Ten Freedom Summers

On his 2013 album\,\nThe Julius Eastman Memory Depot\n(New Amsterdam Records)—which he brings to Roulette—Clayton again leads with his sense of compassion\, wide-eyed exploration\, and razor-sharp intellect\, but instead of using a variety of sources for inspiration\, for the first time\, Clayton has chosen a single\, if multivalent\, subject for his artistic dissection: the life and music of gay\, Black\, pioneering minimalist composer Julius Eastman\, an influential member of the 1980s Downtown New York scene.\nClayton pulls acoustic and digital sounds toward each other by running the the music from two pianos through a laptop\, where he uses custom-built digital tools informed by his acclaimed\nSufi Plug Ins\nproject—one such tool uses the overall volume of the pianos to simultaneously adjust a drone being generated by their pitches—to create an electronic layer built entirely on the pianos’ sound. Clayton chose to focus on two of Eastman’s longest piano works for the album\, “Evil Nigger” and “Gay Guerrilla\,” to allow himself as much opportunity as possible to explore the sound and range of the piano\, Eastman’s rhythmic and muscular writing\, and the internal dynamics of each piece.\nJace Clayton\nelectronics\, voice\nDavid Friend\npiano\nEmily Manzo\npiano\n“You can never quite tell\, listening to the album\, where the sounds are originating\; the sound is a tempest with no center.

He is Assistant Professor of Studio Art and Director of Graduate Studies at the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. Clayton is the author of\nUproot: Travels in 21st Century Music and Digital Culture\n(Farrar\, Straus and Giroux\, 2016) and the forthcoming\nBehold the Monkey\n\, for which he received a 2020 Arts Writers Grant\, about contemporary art\, faith\, and social media. As an artist\, Clayton’s interdisciplinary approach focuses on how sound\, memory\, and public space interact\, with an emphasis on low-income communities and non-Western geographies. His writing appears in publications including\n4Columns\n\,\nArtforum\n\,\nfrieze\n\,\nBidoun\n\, and\nNew York Times Magazine\n. He has performed in over three dozen countries\, as a solo artist and as director of large ensemble performances.

The annual event features Niblock’s iconic multimedia performance style: multiple projections\, mainly of his major film work\nThe Movement of People Working\n(1973-1991)\n\, soundtracked by compositions spanning his over 50 year career.\nThe Movement of People Working\nis a documentary collection of multiple short videos with minimalist editing\, focused on people in their daily activities and tasks of manual labor\, including hammering\, sewing\, weaving\, raking\, harvesting\, dyeing\, fishing\, and more—featuring over 25 hours of mostly 16 mm footage from Peru\, Mexico\, Hungary\, Hong Kong\, Brazil\, Lesotho\, Portugal\, China\, Japan\, Sumatra\, and the Arctic. Accompanied by Niblock’s droning compositions\, the piece is both visually and sonically immersive\, with a rhythmic and unbroken structure.\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nPhill Niblock\n(1933-2024\, USA) was an artist whose fifty-year career spanned minimalist and experimental music\, film\, and photography. Since 1985\, he served as director of Experimental Intermedia\, a foundation for avant-garde music based in New York with a branch in Ghent\, and curator of the foundation’s record label XI. Known for his thick\, loud drones of music\, Niblock’s signature sound is filled with microtones of instrumental timbres that generate many other tones in the performance space. In 2013\, his diverse artistic career was the subject of a retrospective realized in partnership between Circuit (Contemporary Art Centre Lausanne) and Musée de l’Elysée. The following year Niblock was honored with the prestigious Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award.

His “Molecular Systematic Music” is inspired by biological systems which he uses to create unique ensemble music. In his project\, Heroes Are Gang Leaders\, the dense multi-layered sound features the wily poetry of Thomas Sayers Ellis. Abstraction is Deliverance is the latest album from his quartet with pianist Aruán Ortiz\, bassist Brad Jones\, and drummer Chad Taylor and featuring eight of his own compositions. Among other awards\, Lewis is the recipient of the Balvenie Fellowship.
