DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nNew “Jazztronica” compositions inspired by electronic music techniques and UK drum ‘n’ bass\, electro\, and hip-hop.\n\nAaron Burnett\nand his quintet\nthe Big Machine\nreturn to Roulette with new “Jazztronica”compositions inspired by electronic music techniques and sounds from his own long-standing fascination with UK drum ‘n’ bass\, electro\, and hip hop. The band will be paying homage to a classic period in drum ’n’ bass history in which jungle\, drum ‘n’ bass and intelligent / ambient drum ‘n’ bass were all being created in a vibrant co-existent space. Big Machine will also incorporate elements of modern hip hop\, drill music and trap as well providing an elaborate soundscape for the audience. Collectively the band will emulate\, and enhance\, that complex sound-field of machine-based music with jazz improvisation and techniques. But it’s important to note that this isn’t a jazz over drum ‘n’ bass beats set – it’s new material that evolves from elements of machine-produced music\, with those sounds in turn allowing Aaron’s quintet to soar and transcend genre-boundaries. Considering Aaron has performed on two Grammy winning albums\, and has been exploring the zone he calls ‘Jazztronica’ for a good while now\, we can assume that his goal of creating new ‘future music’ sonic atmospheres will be successful. As Aaron notes “Human evolution beyond the machines is upon us…”\nAaron Burnett\ntenor sax\, electronics\, compositions\nPeter Evans\ntrumpet\nCarlos Homs\npiano/keys\nNick Jozwiak\nbass\, synths\nTyshawn Sorey\ndrums\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nProducer\, composer\, performer\, and Grammy-winning saxophonist\nAaron Burnett\nis an up-and-coming jazz star.  After graduating from Berklee College of Music Aaron has made a name for himself performing as a valued sideman with Esperanza Spalding\, Kurt Rosenwinkel\, Vijay Iyer\, and many other big names. However Aaron Burnett is gaining momentum as his own entity.  As the primary composer for his band Aaron Burnett and The Big Machine\, Aaron’s music has been referred to as\, “navigating the crevices and passageways between musical dimensions.” (Philip Booth\, Jazziz Magazine\, March\, 2021) Aaron’s interest in technology has also led him to establish Sistine Criminals\, a live electronic band that plays trap\, hip hop\, R&B\, and creates studio backing tracks for artists.\nPeter Evans\nis a composer\, trumpet player\, bandleader and educator based in New York City.  For 20 years Evans has been pushing the boundaries of creative music in formats as divergent as solo trumpet improvisation\, symphony orchestras\, jazz ensembles\, noise/electronic music\, and through-composed works. He’s been the recipient of awards and commissions worldwide including the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 2022. He’s released 20 albums of original music including the critically acclaimed Ghosts\, Lifeblood and Being & Becoming. A prolific composer and performer\, Evans tours regularly with his groups Being & Becoming\, SYMPHONY\, Forever 21\, as a soloist and as a collaborator with some of the leading lights of modern music.\nCarlos Homs\nis a New York–based pianist\, composer\, and producer whose work spans jazz\, hip‑hop\, and electronic music. He has performed with Steve Lehman\, Reggie Workman\, Bernard Purdie\, DJ Premier\, Feid\, and many others\, and leads his own projects including the trio release The Theory Conspiracy.\nNick Jozwiak\nhas become one of the most in demand young bassist in new york city due to his ferocious stamina\, amazing sound\, excellent playing\, and stage presence.  He has performed with George Garzone\, Peter Evans\, Dave Liebman\, Joel Ross\, and many other great artists.\nTyshawn Sorey\nis a Pulitzer Prize–winning composer\, multi‑instrumentalist\, and professor whose work blurs the line between composition and improvisation. He was awarded the 2024 Pulitzer Prize for Music for Adagio (for Wadada Leo Smith) and is a 2017 MacArthur Fellow. His music has earned global recognition for its genre mobility\, structural daring\, and emotional depth.

Blending light\, video\, and theatrics\, Qas and Steph craft a dystopian protest that fuses music\, theater\, and ritual with irreverent humor. The work reflects on the absurdities and quiet horrors of 80s and 90s daytime television\, not as nostalgia\, but as prophecy\, revealing how its warped portrayals of the American psyche remain eerily relevant today. This east coast debut brings to life Talk Show’s forthcoming 2025 release on WeJazz Records.\nProjections of archival fragments from 1980s and 1990s talk shows such as Sally Jessy Raphael and Jerry Springer will be a backdrop as Steph’s trumpet resonates through drums and bowls of water and Qasim’s synthesizers and percussion build shifting\, hypnotic textures.\nMiss America\ninvites audiences into a shared act of witnessing\; part satire and part mirror of a strange theater of America.\nSteph Richards\ntrumpet and resonating surfaces\nQasim Naqvi\ndrums and modular synthesizer\nSteven Wendt\nlive video and puppeteering\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nTalk Show\nis a new duo collaboration featuring Steph Richards on trumpets and resonating surfaces and Qasim Naqvi on drums and modular synthesizer. Having worked together on other projects for almost two decades\, Talk Show marks their first\, pure duo collaboration – a space to engage with a sonic language they’ve been cultivating together for years. The ensemble features Naqvi crafting real-time electronics and drum set work\, and Richards using trumpets and resonating percussion to summon sympathetic vibrations and otherworldly sounds through timpani\, snare and water.\nSharing an appetite for experimentalism\, theatricality and irreverent collisions of sound and image\, Qasim and Steph met in 2008 at CalArts\, which was a breeding ground for open creative thought and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Often working with directors in the theater program\, choreographers\, or experimental and character animators\, Steph and Qasim’s musical language has a rooting in visual performance art. From their first premiere\, costumed together inside a giant two-person dress sculpture that consumed a drum set\, to their most recent 2025 audio visual nightmare which explores the horrors of 80s daytime reality talk shows\, this duo presents a voice of the grimy and the grotesque: a new beauty of questionable acts and character flaws in sound\nSteven Wendt\nis a versatile performer\, puppeteer\, and devised theater creator with decades of experience in immersive performance art. Known for his work with Blue Man Group and innovative hand shadow puppetry\, Wendt has collaborated on groundbreaking multimedia productions such as THIS & THAT. His artistry spans acting\, music\, puppetry\, and visual arts\, earning him recognition through prestigious awards for innovation and excellence in theatrical effects.\nWendt’s video feedback performance is a dynamic interplay of light and time—a modern cave painting illuminated by projection. Using two vintage Sony camcorders and no computer effects\, the work explores infinite visual recursion reminiscent of facing mirrors\, where each subtle crank of the tripod or zoom becomes an act of delicate fractal navigation. Its beauty lies in the difficulty to control it\, in the struggle to constrain what is fleeting\, boundless and evolving. Here the camera achieves strange consciousness\, turning its mechanical eye upon its own seeing\, revealing the hidden loop that has haunted our image-making since the first photograph fixed shadows onto silver two centuries ago.\nWendt received The Puppeteers of America – Jim Henson Award for Innovation (2023)

Their formal training is in Performance Studies\, studying with esteemed theorists and practitioners at Brown University (BA) and New York University (MA).

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nComposer of the acclaimed Odesa Suite premieres new work\, out on John Zorn's Tzadik label\, feat. Pauline Kim Harris\, Celia Hatton\, and Andrew […]\n\nPianist and composer\nVadim Neselovskyi\n—praised by The New York Times for his “finely wrought detail and glinting elegance\,” recognized by The Guardian for his “extraordinary playing\,” and described by All About Jazz as “a composer who blends form and freedom in new ways”—presents\nPerseverantia\n\, a powerful suite for piano and string trio.\nAs a Ukrainian artist\, Neselovskyi brings profound emotional depth to this work\, which reflects on compassion\, resilience\, and the endurance of the human spirit. While inspired by the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine\,\nPerseverantia\ntranscends politics—it is a universal meditation on courage and hope in times of struggle.\nMusically\, the piece bridges worlds: blending the lyricism of Eastern European folk traditions with post-war avant-garde textures\, minimalistic patterns\, and metal-influenced grooves. The result is a sound world that is both intimate and explosive\, architectural yet deeply emotional.\nThe recording—executive produced by John Zorn—will be released on Tzadik Records on February 24\, 2026. For his Roulette performance\, Neselovskyi teams up with leading figures of New York’s contemporary music scene: violinist\nPauline Kim Harris\n\, violist\nCelia Hatton\n\, and cellist\nAndrew Janss\n.\nPauline Kim Harris\nviolin\nCelia Hatton\nviola\nAndrew Janss\ncello\nVadim Neselovskyi\npiano\, composition\n“Placing exhilarating piano improvisations in the context of gorgeous compositions for classical string trio\,\nPerseverantia\nis Vadim’s greatest work to date.” –Tzadik Records\n“\nVadim\nNeselovskyi’s … pianism shares the qualities of a sculpture carved in ice: finely wrought detail\, sharply traced\; glinting elegance\; coolness to the touch\; refractions of light. His right and left hands converse with each other in eager\, enchanted dialogue.” –The New York Times\nNeselovskyi’s background is as multifaceted as his music. Born in Odesa\, trained in Germany\, and now based in Boston—where he serves as a professor at Berklee College of Music and MIT—he has forged a career bridging genres and continents. His collaborators include Gary Burton\, John Zorn\, Arkady Shilkloper\, and Julian Lage\, among others. His previous album\,\nOdesa\n\, was named one of The Boston Globe’s Best Albums of 2022 and featured by The New York Times as one of the “Five Classical Albums You Can Check Out Now.”\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nAs a young composer and pianist growing up in Odesa\, Ukraine\,\nVadim Neselovskyi\ndiscovered that his calling was not to follow any one stylistic path but to become a “creator of music.” He’s long since fulfilled that early promise in myriad ways both inventive and unexpected: as a composer whose vision is expansive enough to spark inspired interpretations from jazz trio and symphony orchestra alike\; as an improviser carving surprising pathways through the straight ahead\, the avant-garde\, and the indefinable\; and as a collaborator valued by peers\, mentors and fellow innovators.\nThe\nLos Angeles Times\nhas praised Neselovskyi’s “extraordinary playing” while\nThe Guardian\n(UK) called him “the most promising of the young improvisers.” Whether as a pianist\, composer\, improviser\, soloist or bandleader\, Neselovskyi creates music that is truly inspired and wholly unique. His work has been played by jazz greats like\nRandy Brecker\n\,\nAntonio Sanchez\n\,\nJulian Lage\n\, and\nGary Burton\n\, as well as classical artists (\nDaniel Gauthier\n\, whose recording of Neselovskyi’s “San Felio” won an ECHO Classical Award) and symphony orchestras in the United States and Europe.\nThose diverse talents have attracted the attention of revered artists crossing the boundaries of genre\, including legendary vibraphonist\nGary Burton\n\, who famously enlisted Neselovskyi for his acclaimed Generations Quintet\; the prestigious Graz Philharmoniker\, which performed his composition “Prelude for Vibes” on their New Year’s program\; iconoclastic composer/saxophonist\nJohn Zorn\n\, who invited Neselovskyi to contribute to\nThe Book Beriah\n\, the final installment of his Masada project\; and French horn/alphorn pioneer\nArkady Shilkloper\n\, a profound influence with whom the pianist now shares a longstanding duo collaboration.\nIn 2022\, he paid tribute to his hometown with\nOdesa\n\, a ruminative and poetic solo piano album featuring compositions inspired by Ukrainian landmarks like the Odesa Railway Station\, Potemkin Stairs\, and Odesa Conservatory. The New York Times classical critic Seth Colter Walls recently featured\nOdesa\nin “5 CLASSICAL ALBUMS YOU CAN LISTEN TO RIGHT NOW”. Additionally the album has had recent media hits on NPR Morning Edition\, WNYC’s All of It with Alison Stewart\, The PBS Newshour\, The Boston Globe and many others all over Germany\, Spain\, France\, the U.K. and elsewhere.
