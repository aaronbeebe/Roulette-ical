DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nAnnual 3-night celebration of the late guitarist\, bringing together rotating combinations of master improvisers—selected by 3 guest curators.\n\nJoin us for the\nfourth annual three-night celebration of the late guitarist Derek Bailey\, bringing together master improvisers to perform in rotating combinations. This year Roulette co-founder and former Artistic Director Jim Staley invited three guest curators to put together the lineups: Wendy Eisenberg (1.22)\, Chris Ryan Williams (1.23)\, and Chris Cochrane (1.24).\nImprov Nights was originally initiated by John Zorn\, to whom Derek Bailey was a dear friend and mentor. Bailey’s passion for pure improvisation inspired generations of musicians from a wide variety of backgrounds. For these three nights we return to the Improv Night tradition that began as benefits for The Stone\, and that have been\, in many ways\, inspired by Derek Bailey’s legendary Company Weeks. Each evening will present a rotating kaleidoscope of musicians\, who will then divide into smaller improvisational units—each concert promising a unique experience.\nThursday\, January 22 // Curated by Wendy Eisenberg\nEliza Salem\ndrums\nRyan Sawyer\ndrums\nKate Gentile\ndrums\nNora Stanley\nsax\nEmmanuel Michael\nguitar\nCharmaine Lee\nvoice/electronics\nPatrick Holmes\nclarinet\nWendy Eisenberg\nguitar\nFriday\, January 23 // Curated by Chris Ryan Williams\nZeena Parkins\nharp\nBooker Stardrum\ndrums\nNate Wooley\ntrumpet\nKwami Winfield\nelectronics\nCaroline Davis\nsaxophone\nRyan Sawyer\ndrums\nAlexandra Buschman-Román\nelectronics\, vocals\nPatrick Holmes\nclarinet\nAmir ElSaffar\ntrumpet\nRafiq Batia\nguitar\nChris Williams\ntrumpet\nSaturday\, January 24 // Curated by Chris Cochrane\nSam Newsome\nsoprano sax\nDafna Naphtali\nelectronics and voice\nJames Ilgenfritz\nupright bass\nMike Pride\ndrums and percussion\nAndrew Drury\ndrums and percussion\nTheo Woodward\nelectronics\, tambura and voice\nKa Baird\nvocals\nSelendis Sebastian Alexander Johnson\nvibraphone and trombone\nShoko Nagai\npiano\, accordion and other keyboard and electronics\nSarah Bernstein\nviolin and vocals\nChris Cochrane\nguitar

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nThree performances on piano and guitar that challenge perceived norms of intimacy and collaboration.\n\nThree artist groups present works that challenge perceived norms of intimacy and collaboration:\nEmily Manzo\nperforms solo piano collaborations with works by composers\nMary Halvorson\nand\nAaron Siegel\n\;\nBent Duo\n(David Friend on piano and Bill Solomon on percussion) perform Friend’s composition\nJudys\n\, and\nNaama Tsabar\nand\nKristin Mueller\nperform Tsabar’s\nUntitled (Double Face)\nwhere both performers will activate a two necked guitar  made by Tsabar\, requiring them to lean on each other\, negotiating movement and sound while playing.\nEmily Manzo\npiano\nDavid Friend\npiano\nBill Solomon\npercussion\nNaama Tsabar\nguitar\nKristin Mueller\nguitar\n“[Emily Manzo is] a uniquely protean artist who makes several scenes move” –Time Out New York\n“[Bent Duo] created a virtuosic sonic performance\, an environment where all the senses were heightened.” –The Brooklyn Rail\n“Tsabar’s ‘deviant’ musical instruments invite chance and collaboration into the hallowed spaces of art” –ArtReview\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nEmily Manzo\nis a pianist\, vocalist\, composer\, and arts organizer whom TimeOut New York calls “a uniquely protean artist who makes several scenes move\,” with The New York Times applauding her “exceptional attention to detail.” She has performed extensively across the U.S. and Europe in chamber\, experimental\, and rock music settings.\nHer collaborative work spans many disciplines. She scored filmmaker Paul Rowley’s 2010 experimental feature\nThe Rooms\n\, which premiered at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. She has received songwriting and opera commissions from presenters including Bayerischer Rundfunk and Experiments in Opera\, and has been fortunate to perform on Naama Tsabar’s sculptural\, site-specific instruments.\nEmily is a member of the Julius Eastman Memorial Dinner and has toured with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company\, Till by Turning\, Arooj Aftab\, and the duo Christy & Emily. As a vocalist and pianist\, her recordings appear on Tzadik\, New Amsterdam Records\, SHSK’H\, The Social Registry\, Big Print\, Klangbad\, Merge\, and Jagjaguwar.\nBent Duo\nis a NYC-based experimental project that performs and creates innovative work. Founders Bill Solomon and David Friend come from classical music backgrounds and are deeply engaged in NYC’s New Music scene\, with active careers performing with major ensembles and at celebrated venues and festivals in NYC\, nationally\, and abroad. In Bent Duo\, they explore the outer reaches of experimental music practice and investigate new techniques for creating and performing new works that transcend conventional boundaries between disciplines\, frequently with a focus on queer aesthetics and social practice. They have created a varied body of original work\, including a performance piece premiered at Harvard Art Museums\, collaborative electroacoustic music with Jace Clayton\, a text-based work for Queer Percussion Research Group\, and numerous installation works for community gardens and historic queer spaces. They have been invited to lecture on their work at institutions including Hartford Art School\, Bard College\, Louisiana State University\, University of Leeds (UK)\, and Yale University.\nNaama Tsabar’s\npractice fuses elements from sculpture\, music\, performance and architecture. Her interactive works expose hidden spaces and systems\, reconceive gendered narratives\, and shift the viewing experience to one of active participation. Tsabar draws attention to the muted and unseen by propagating sound through space and sculptural form. Between sculpture and instrument\, form and sound\, Tsabar’s work lingers on the intimate\, sensual and corporeal potentials within this transitional state. Collaborating with local communities of female identifying and gender non-conforming performers\, Tsabar writes a new feminist and queer history of fluency. Tsabar’s work was presented and performed in institutions internationally\, among them The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York)\, MoMA PS1 (New York)\, Palais de Tokyo (Paris)\, The Bass Museum (Miami)\, SFMoMA (San Francisco) and the Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart (Berlin).

Known for his atmospheric compositions with Bing & Ruth\, as well as his collaborations with guitarist Steve Gunn and Cowboy Sadness\, these new works mark Moore’s first widely shared solo piano music.\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nAt the forefront of contemporary instrumental music\, the work of composer and pianist\nDavid Moore\ngently defies genre. Hailing from Kansas\, his folk heritage\, alongside his affinity for natural landscapes and spiritual inquiry\, infuse his music today. Moore relocated to New York in 2004 where he met like-minded musicians exploring atmospheric\, instrumental-based composition. From that creative circle\, Bing & Ruth was born. As leader of the ensemble\, Moore earned acclaim for his spaciously sublime compositions.\nHe continues to expand his sound through collaboration\, experimentation\, and intuitive discipline. In addition to four full-length albums and five EPs with Bing & Ruth\, Moore has also released collaborations with Steve Gunn (Let the Moon Be a Planet and Live in London) and Cowboy Sadness (Selected Jambient Works\, Vol. 1). From his earliest works to his most recent albums\nButterfly Gardens\nand\nGraze the Bell\n\, his solo work only deepens the intimate presence central to his art. Merging trance-inducing atmospheres with melodic-driven composition\, Moore’s art thrives in liminality.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nNew “Jazztronica” compositions inspired by electronic music techniques and UK drum ‘n’ bass\, electro\, and hip-hop.\n\nAaron Burnett\nand his quintet\nthe Big Machine\nreturn to Roulette with new “Jazztronica”compositions inspired by electronic music techniques and sounds from his own long-standing fascination with UK drum ‘n’ bass\, electro\, and hip hop. The band will be paying homage to a classic period in drum ’n’ bass history in which jungle\, drum ‘n’ bass and intelligent / ambient drum ‘n’ bass were all being created in a vibrant co-existent space. Big Machine will also incorporate elements of modern hip hop\, drill music and trap as well providing an elaborate soundscape for the audience. Collectively the band will emulate\, and enhance\, that complex sound-field of machine-based music with jazz improvisation and techniques. But it’s important to note that this isn’t a jazz over drum ‘n’ bass beats set – it’s new material that evolves from elements of machine-produced music\, with those sounds in turn allowing Aaron’s quintet to soar and transcend genre-boundaries. Considering Aaron has performed on two Grammy winning albums\, and has been exploring the zone he calls ‘Jazztronica’ for a good while now\, we can assume that his goal of creating new ‘future music’ sonic atmospheres will be successful.

However Aaron Burnett is gaining momentum as his own entity.  As the primary composer for his band Aaron Burnett and The Big Machine\, Aaron’s music has been referred to as\, “navigating the crevices and passageways between musical dimensions.” (Philip Booth\, Jazziz Magazine\, March\, 2021) Aaron’s interest in technology has also led him to establish Sistine Criminals\, a live electronic band that plays trap\, hip hop\, R&B\, and creates studio backing tracks for artists.\nPeter Evans\nis a composer\, trumpet player\, bandleader and educator based in New York City.  For 20 years Evans has been pushing the boundaries of creative music in formats as divergent as solo trumpet improvisation\, symphony orchestras\, jazz ensembles\, noise/electronic music\, and through-composed works. He’s been the recipient of awards and commissions worldwide including the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 2022. He’s released 20 albums of original music including the critically acclaimed Ghosts\, Lifeblood and Being & Becoming. A prolific composer and performer\, Evans tours regularly with his groups Being & Becoming\, SYMPHONY\, Forever 21\, as a soloist and as a collaborator with some of the leading lights of modern music.\nCarlos Homs\nis a New York–based pianist\, composer\, and producer whose work spans jazz\, hip‑hop\, and electronic music. He has performed with Steve Lehman\, Reggie Workman\, Bernard Purdie\, DJ Premier\, Feid\, and many others\, and leads his own projects including the trio release The Theory Conspiracy.\nNick Jozwiak\nhas become one of the most in demand young bassist in new york city due to his ferocious stamina\, amazing sound\, excellent playing\, and stage presence.  He has performed with George Garzone\, Peter Evans\, Dave Liebman\, Joel Ross\, and many other great artists.\nTyshawn Sorey\nis a Pulitzer Prize–winning composer\, multi‑instrumentalist\, and professor whose work blurs the line between composition and improvisation. He was awarded the 2024 Pulitzer Prize for Music for Adagio (for Wadada Leo Smith) and is a 2017 MacArthur Fellow. His music has earned global recognition for its genre mobility\, structural daring\, and emotional depth.

Through five historical case studies—chapters on early cybernetic electronic systems developed by Morton Subotnick\, Donald Buchla\, Pauline Oliveros\, Alvin Lucier\, and Sun Ra—Gordon’s book develops a concept of “ex-composition” that accounts for experiences of playing with instruments that play themselves\, and the consequences those experiences hold for understanding the musical self in an increasingly informational world.\nAfter a panel discussion and Q&A\, Gordon will be joined by frequent collaborator\nMarcia Bassett\n(electronics)\, as well as\nKeith Fullerton Whitman\n(electronics)\, and\nLuke Stewart\n(bass) for improvised performances that build on the conversation in solo and duo formations.\nTed Gordon\nauthor\, Buchla Music Easel\nMarcia Bassett\npanelist\, Buchla Music Easel\nKeith Fullerton\nWhitman\npanelist\, electronics\nLuke Stewart\npanelist\, bass\n“How can information systems make music? And when they do what happens to composers? This fascinating book reveals how electronic music cracked open questions of what it meant to be human at the dawn of the digital age. Read it\, and you’ll never hear a synthesizer quite the same way again.”—Fred Turner\, author of\nThe Democratic Surround: Multimedia and American Liberalism from World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties\n“Gordon tells five compelling stories of musical creativity and cybernetics in the Information Age. But this is not a tale of technological determinism.\nThe Composer’s Black Box\nshows us not how music was shaped by oscillators\, circuit boards\, and voltage controls but how deeply all of this depended on the imaginations of the people who used these technologies\, their diverse notions of agency\, and\, ultimately\, their visions of freedom and control.”—Emily I. Dolan\, author of\nThe Orchestral Revolution: Haydn and the Technologies of Timbre\n“At last we have a detailed\, sophisticated history of the impact cybernetic thinking had on the music of the 1960s\, 1970s\, and beyond. Gordon’s book represents an important intervention into postwar music history—one that is as urgent as ever\, given cybernetics’ role in laying the groundwork for contemporary digital culture.”—Eric Drott\, author of\nStreaming Music\, Streaming Capital\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nTed Gordon\nis Assistant Professor of Music at Baruch College and the Graduate Center\, City University of New York. He is the author of\nThe Composer’s Black Box: Making Music in Cybernetic America\n(University of California Press\, 2025)\, as well as several book chapters and articles that explore frictions between experimental music\, electronic instruments\, and contemporary science & technology.

Known for creating music at the intersection of contemporary improvisation and folk traditions\, a recent review in The Wire of Warpeha’s latest collaborative record\nOrbweaver\n(Outside Time)\, describes the work as “Improvisation that\, in spite of its experimental edge\, feels decidedly human.”\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nMichael Foster\nwith Strings is a radical take on the soloist-with-strings tradition. Inverting\, exposing\, & subverting the power relations therein\, while mining the tradition for clues to a more queer and equitable future within both repertoire and the dynamics between ensemble and bandleader. This projects aims to unpack the concept of a Great American Songbook by placing that repertoire in dialogue with works by overlooked\, contemporary composers\, and with an approach to ensemble playing that integrates elements of noise and free improvisation. This ensemble proposes approaching standards and composition with the same dynamism and openness as free improvisation\, but with a keen awareness of power relations and commitment to form.\nZosha Warpeha\nis a Brooklyn-based composer-performer working in a meditative space at the intersection of contemporary improvisation and folk traditions. Using bowed stringed instruments alongside her own voice\, her long-form compositions explore transformations of time\, tonality\, and resonant space. She performs primarily on Hardanger d’amore\, a sympathetic-stringed instrument closely related to the Norwegian Hardanger fiddle. While her work is informed by the cyclical forms and physical momentum of Nordic folk music\, her solo practice “subvert[s] tradition not as a political act\, but as a point of departure” (Peter Margasak\, Nowhere Street).\nShe was a 2025 artist-in-residence at ISSUE Project Room and her work has also been supported by the US-Norway Fulbright Foundation\, Jerome Foundation\, and the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund. Her second solo album\,\nI grow accustomed to the dark\n\, will be released on Outside Time in early 2026.\nLeila Bordreuil\nis a French-American cellist\, composer and sound-artist based in Brooklyn\, NY. She accesses concepts as diverse as noise\, contemporary classical\, free jazz\, and experimental traditions but adheres to none of them. Her music mixes deep melancholia with harsh noise-walls at ear-bleeding levels\, and was described by The New York Times as “steadily scathing music\, favoring long and corrosive atonalities”.\nNava Dunkelman\nis a percussionist and improviser based in Brooklyn\, NY. Born in Tokyo\, Japan and raised in a multi-cultural environment by an American father and Indonesian mother. Her musical approach is innovative and dynamic\, combining virtuosity and intuition. Meticulous in an intrinsic way\, she uses her distinctive sound palette to explore and give life to a vast spectrum of musical possibilities.\nAnna Abondolo\nA native of California and based in Brooklyn\, Anna Abondolo is a multidisciplinary artist whose work spans music\, movement\, art\, and theater. A graduate from the New England Conservatory\, Anna studied bass performance with a concentration in music technology. Curious about individual experience\, her work investigates memory\, spatial environments\, and their relationship to the body. Anna uses a combination of traditional notation\, graphic scores\, and text\, writing for instrumental ensembles\, vocalists\, electronics\, song\, and bodies.\nWebb Crawford\nis a guitarist\, tenor banjoist\, and instrument-builder who works in free and structured improvisation. Their focus as a builder is in modern reinterpretations of historical stringed instruments\, and they have led instrument-building workshops at The Cooper Union\, Connecticut College\, and the Bennington Museum.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nA new ensemble work of plucked\, beaten and electronic instruments in surround sound for Stemeseder's Roulette Commission.\n\nThis new work\, developed for\nElias Stemeseder\n‘s 2024-25 Roulette Commission\, investigates rhythmic\, melodic and formal implications arising from non-idiomatic treatment of an adjusted meantone tuning. Emerging from\nStemeseder’s\nongoing personal interest in historic keyboard instruments and the repertoire composed for them\, the piece attempts to reconcile this fascination with his contemporary artistic practice and methods. Informed by research into the particular possibilities and constraints of Harpsichord temperaments with twelve notes per octave—and the aesthetic priorities that shaped their propagation—the work aims to deprioritize and deconstruct some of the goals these theories originally sought to accommodate.\nThe work is performed by the\nlongstanding producer-duo Stemeseder-Lil Injure\n(S-L) and an ensemble of plucked\, struck and electronic instruments\, continuing S-L’s interest in the juxtaposition of archaic sound-making tools and practices with contemporary technology.\nDoYeon Kim\ngayageum\nSimon Kanzler\ndigital signal processing\, sound spatialisation\nShakoor Hakeem\npercussion\nKris Chen Lil’Injure\ndrum set\, percussion\nElias\nStemeseder\nlautenwerk\, synthesizers\, samples\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing. Watch below or on YouTube.\nElias Stemeseder\nis a pianist\, keyboard instrumentalist\, electronic musician and composer with an interest in synthesizing musical thought\, discipline and tools from diverse time periods and geographic origins to create original sonic ordering principles. Performing on historic and contemporary (keyboard-) instruments\, Stemeseder is part of the ensembles Stemeseder-Lillinger\, Neon Dilemma\, WRENS and the Elias Stemeseder Trio. He also works alongside luminaries such as Anna Webber\, Adam O’Farrill\, Craig Taborn\, Ingrid Laubrock\, Thomas Morgan and Peter Evans\, performs as a soloist\, and is a recording artist for Intakt Records.

Since 1985\, he served as director of Experimental Intermedia\, a foundation for avant-garde music based in New York with a branch in Ghent\, and curator of the foundation’s record label XI. Known for his thick\, loud drones of music\, Niblock’s signature sound is filled with microtones of instrumental timbres that generate many other tones in the performance space. In 2013\, his diverse artistic career was the subject of a retrospective realized in partnership between Circuit (Contemporary Art Centre Lausanne) and Musée de l’Elysée. The following year Niblock was honored with the prestigious Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award.

Opening the evening is a set by experimental pedal steel guitarist and Lobby Art Editions co label head\nSam Wenc\n\, with collaborators\, to premiere his latest album\nLanguage At An Angle\n.\nDebuting in January 2024 the Shaker Ensemble is shepherded by a trust based composition within the framing of the phasing\, audio-hallucinatory playing of the maracas. Born out of a need for healing and self soothing\, the ensemble has grown into a participatory event that incudes the audience and architecture of every building it presents in.\nRyan Sawyer Shaker Ensemble\nRyan Sawyer\nmaracas\, voice\nLaura Cocks\nflutes\, voice\nisa crespo pardo\nvoice\nNate Wooley\ntrumpet\, voice\nJessica Pavone\nviola\, voice\nHenry Fraser\nbass\, voice\nMadison Greenstone\nclarinets\, voice\nFrom\nLanguage At An Angle\nliner notes\, by Jack Braunstein:\n“Language At An Angle” is the latest offering from\nSam Wenc\n(fka Post Moves)\; an eight-part tone poem and journey through the heart\, and\, as the title suggests\, a reflection on meaning itself. Fleshed out with a crew of wildly talented improvisor-composers\, the music sits in a unique place at the edges of free-improvisation\, East Asian court music\, and the overtone-centered wizardry of drone technicians like Ellen Fullman and Kali Malone.\nThis performance will be the premiere of this material in large ensemble format after a year of solo performances that took Sam from Arizona to Japan. The music retains the intensity of its original form while only revealing more deeply the intricacies of its textural and melodic accomplishments. As an expression of states encountered through Wenc’s extended engagements with long durations of sitting meditation\, it is a truthful and profoundly beautiful record. As a fully-realized album from one of the best avant-garde pedal steel players in the game with 13 years of sound exploration and technique development under his belt\, it’s monumental.\nCompositionally and spiritually\, there is no greater influence on this record than the late Susan Alcorn\, to whom the album is dedicated. Like all of those who had the privilege to be taught by Susan\, Wenc was transformed by her presence and generosity. While her boundless creativity and fierce technical ability on the instrument are a treasure to all open-minded steel players\, what I understand Sam to treasure most about her mentorship were the more intangible things–the wholeness of spirit that she brought to her playing and relationships\, and her sensitivities to the spiritual forces of the world. Susan’s passing was a devastating loss for her community: there are some transformations for which you can’t prepare. What Language at an Angle offers instead is a practice of making meaning in this world\, tenuously\, temporarily\, as it is\, deeply. And in doing so\, he is passing on a gift. Ready or not\, we might need it.\n“The singular music of pedal steel guitarist\, Sam Wenc…takes an instrument that is usually associated in a cliche way and turns it into something very atmospheric and expansive” – WNYC\nSam Wenc + Friends\nSam Wenc\npedal steel\nSam Yulsman\npiano\nJoey Sullivan\ndrums\nJohn Moran\nbass\nVictor Vieira Branco\nvibraphone\nWill Henriksen\nviolin\nMatthew Lee\nbass clarinet/saxophone\nJack Braunstein\nclarinet\nisabel crespo pardo\nvocals\nBorn in 1976 in San Antonio\, Texas\,\nRyan Sawyer\nstarted playing drums at 11\, learning his craft through an early exposure to not only rock and jazz but also the colloquial conjunto\, zydeco\, and punk rock musics of his home town.

DESCRIPTION:Tickets $25\nPurchase Tickets\nComposer of the acclaimed Odesa Suite premieres new work\, out on John Zorn's Tzadik label\, feat. Pauline Kim Harris\, Celia Hatton\, and Andrew […]\n\nPianist and composer\nVadim Neselovskyi\n—praised by The New York Times for his “finely wrought detail and glinting elegance\,” recognized by The Guardian for his “extraordinary playing\,” and described by All About Jazz as “a composer who blends form and freedom in new ways”—presents\nPerseverantia\n\, a powerful suite for piano and string trio.\nAs a Ukrainian artist\, Neselovskyi brings profound emotional depth to this work\, which reflects on compassion\, resilience\, and the endurance of the human spirit. While inspired by the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine\,\nPerseverantia\ntranscends politics—it is a universal meditation on courage and hope in times of struggle.\nMusically\, the piece bridges worlds: blending the lyricism of Eastern European folk traditions with post-war avant-garde textures\, minimalistic patterns\, and metal-influenced grooves. The result is a sound world that is both intimate and explosive\, architectural yet deeply emotional.\nThe recording—executive produced by John Zorn—will be released on Tzadik Records on February 24\, 2026. For his Roulette performance\, Neselovskyi teams up with leading figures of New York’s contemporary music scene: violinist\nPauline Kim Harris\n\, violist\nCelia Hatton\n\, and cellist\nAndrew Janss\n.\nPauline Kim\nHarris violin\nCelia Hatton\nviola\nAndrew Janss\ncello\nVadim Neselovskyi\npiano\, composition\n“Placing exhilarating piano improvisations in the context of gorgeous compositions for classical string trio\,\nPerseverantia\nis Vadim’s greatest work to date.” –Tzadik Records\n“\nVadim\nNeselovskyi’s … pianism shares the qualities of a sculpture carved in ice: finely wrought detail\, sharply traced\; glinting elegance\; coolness to the touch\; refractions of light. His right and left hands converse with each other in eager\, enchanted dialogue.” –The New York Times\nNeselovskyi’s background is as multifaceted as his music. Born in Odesa\, trained in Germany\, and now based in Boston—where he serves as a professor at Berklee College of Music and MIT—he has forged a career bridging genres and continents. His collaborators include Gary Burton\, John Zorn\, Arkady Shilkloper\, and Julian Lage\, among others. His previous album\,\nOdesa\n\, was named one of The Boston Globe’s Best Albums of 2022 and featured by The New York Times as one of the “Five Classical Albums You Can Check Out Now.”\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nAs a young composer and pianist growing up in Odesa\, Ukraine\,\nVadim Neselovskyi\ndiscovered that his calling was not to follow any one stylistic path but to become a “creator of music.” He’s long since fulfilled that early promise in myriad ways both inventive and unexpected: as a composer whose vision is expansive enough to spark inspired interpretations from jazz trio and symphony orchestra alike\; as an improviser carving surprising pathways through the straight ahead\, the avant-garde\, and the indefinable\; and as a collaborator valued by peers\, mentors and fellow innovators.\nThe\nLos Angeles Times\nhas praised Neselovskyi’s “extraordinary playing” while\nThe Guardian\n(UK) called him “the most promising of the young improvisers.” Whether as a pianist\, composer\, improviser\, soloist or bandleader\, Neselovskyi creates music that is truly inspired and wholly unique. His work has been played by jazz greats like\nRandy Brecker\n\,\nAntonio Sanchez\n\,\nJulian Lage\n\, and\nGary Burton\n\, as well as classical artists (\nDaniel Gauthier\n\, whose recording of Neselovskyi’s “San Felio” won an ECHO Classical Award) and symphony orchestras in the United States and Europe.\nThose diverse talents have attracted the attention of revered artists crossing the boundaries of genre\, including legendary vibraphonist\nGary Burton\n\, who famously enlisted Neselovskyi for his acclaimed Generations Quintet\; the prestigious Graz Philharmoniker\, which performed his composition “Prelude for Vibes” on their New Year’s program\; iconoclastic composer/saxophonist\nJohn Zorn\n\, who invited Neselovskyi to contribute to\nThe Book Beriah\n\, the final installment of his Masada project\; and French horn/alphorn pioneer\nArkady Shilkloper\n\, a profound influence with whom the pianist now shares a longstanding duo collaboration.\nIn 2022\, he paid tribute to his hometown with\nOdesa\n\, a ruminative and poetic solo piano album featuring compositions inspired by Ukrainian landmarks like the Odesa Railway Station\, Potemkin Stairs\, and Odesa Conservatory. The New York Times classical critic Seth Colter Walls recently featured\nOdesa\nin “5 CLASSICAL ALBUMS YOU CAN LISTEN TO RIGHT NOW”. Additionally the album has had recent media hits on NPR Morning Edition\, WNYC’s All of It with Alison Stewart\, The PBS Newshour\, The Boston Globe and many others all over Germany\, Spain\, France\, the U.K. and elsewhere.

Blending light\, video\, and theatrics\, Qas and Steph craft a dystopian protest that fuses music\, theater\, and ritual with irreverent humor. The work reflects on the absurdities and quiet horrors of 80s and 90s daytime television\, not as nostalgia\, but as prophecy\, revealing how its warped portrayals of the American psyche remain eerily relevant today. This east coast debut brings to life Talk Show’s forthcoming 2025 release on WeJazz Records.\nProjections of archival fragments from 1980s and 1990s talk shows such as Sally Jessy Raphael and Jerry Springer will be a backdrop as Steph’s trumpet resonates through drums and bowls of water and Qasim’s synthesizers and percussion build shifting\, hypnotic textures.\nMiss America\ninvites audiences into a shared act of witnessing\; part satire and part mirror of a strange theater of America.\nSteph Richards\ntrumpet and resonating surfaces\nQasim Naqvi\ndrums and modular synthesizer\nSteven Wendt\nlive video and puppeteering\nA livestream will be available free of charge at 8pm on the day of the performance and archived for future viewing.\nTalk Show\nis a new duo collaboration featuring Steph Richards on trumpets and resonating surfaces and Qasim Naqvi on drums and modular synthesizer. Having worked together on other projects for almost two decades\, Talk Show marks their first\, pure duo collaboration – a space to engage with a sonic language they’ve been cultivating together for years. The ensemble features Naqvi crafting real-time electronics and drum set work\, and Richards using trumpets and resonating percussion to summon sympathetic vibrations and otherworldly sounds through timpani\, snare and water.\nSharing an appetite for experimentalism\, theatricality and irreverent collisions of sound and image\, Qasim and Steph met in 2008 at CalArts\, which was a breeding ground for open creative thought and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Often working with directors in the theater program\, choreographers\, or experimental and character animators\, Steph and Qasim’s musical language has a rooting in visual performance art. From their first premiere\, costumed together inside a giant two-person dress sculpture that consumed a drum set\, to their most recent 2025 audio visual nightmare which explores the horrors of 80s daytime reality talk shows\, this duo presents a voice of the grimy and the grotesque: a new beauty of questionable acts and character flaws in sound\nSteven Wendt\nis a versatile performer\, puppeteer\, and devised theater creator with decades of experience in immersive performance art. Known for his work with Blue Man Group and innovative hand shadow puppetry\, Wendt has collaborated on groundbreaking multimedia productions such as THIS & THAT. His artistry spans acting\, music\, puppetry\, and visual arts\, earning him recognition through prestigious awards for innovation and excellence in theatrical effects.\nWendt’s video feedback performance is a dynamic interplay of light and time—a modern cave painting illuminated by projection. Using two vintage Sony camcorders and no computer effects\, the work explores infinite visual recursion reminiscent of facing mirrors\, where each subtle crank of the tripod or zoom becomes an act of delicate fractal navigation. Its beauty lies in the difficulty to control it\, in the struggle to constrain what is fleeting\, boundless and evolving. Here the camera achieves strange consciousness\, turning its mechanical eye upon its own seeing\, revealing the hidden loop that has haunted our image-making since the first photograph fixed shadows onto silver two centuries ago.\nWendt received The Puppeteers of America – Jim Henson Award for Innovation (2023)
